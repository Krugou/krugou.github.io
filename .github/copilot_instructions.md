# The Immigrants - Incremental Game Development Instructions

## Project Overview

You are helping develop "The Immigrants", a Flutter web/Android incremental game about population movement and territory expansion. The game features a single resource (people) that increases/decreases as immigrants move into new territories through random events.

## Game Mechanics to Implement

### Core Systems

- **Single Resource**: People as the only resource
- **Territory Expansion**: Unlock new territories through population thresholds
- **Event System**: Random events that trigger population movement
- **Population Migration**: People move between territories based on events

### Key Features

- Population counter (main resource)
- Territory unlock system
- Random event generator with separate event lists per territory
- Population migration between territories
- Event outcomes affecting population numbers
- Auto-save/load functionality

### Resource Mechanics

- **People**: The only resource in the game
- **Population Growth**: Increases through positive events (births, immigration)
- **Population Loss**: Decreases through negative events (emigration, disasters)
- **Territory Capacity**: Each territory has population limits

### Event System

- **Separate Event Lists**: Each territory has its own event pool
- **Random Triggers**: Events fire based on timers or population thresholds
- **Population Effects**: Events directly increase/decrease people count
- **Territory Migration**: Events can move people between territories
- **Event Types**: Immigration waves, natural disasters, economic opportunities, conflicts

### Territory System

- **Territory Unlock**: New territories unlock at population milestones
- **Population Distribution**: People spread across available territories
- **Territory Events**: Each territory has unique event types
- **Migration Paths**: People can move between connected territories

## Technical Requirements

### Flutter Structure

- Use Provider for state management
- Implement game loop with Timer.periodic for events
- SharedPreferences for save/load
- Responsive UI for web and mobile
- Material Design components

### Code Patterns

- Separate event logic from UI
- Use notifyListeners() for population updates
- Implement event probability systems
- Add number formatting for population counts
- Territory-specific event pools

### UI Components Needed

- Population counter (prominent display)
- Territory list with population breakdown
- Event log/history display
- Territory unlock indicators
- Event outcome notifications
- Settings/reset options

## Naming Conventions

- Use snake_case for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes
- Prefix private variables with underscore
- Use descriptive names related to immigration and territory themes

## Immigration Theme Elements

- Territory types (rural villages, urban centers, border regions)
- Event categories (economic migration, family reunification, refuge seeking)
- Population dynamics (birth rates, emigration patterns)
- Migration reasons (opportunity, safety, family)
- Territory characteristics affecting event types

## Event System Details

- **Event Structure**: Each event has description, population effect, probability
- **Territory Events**: Events specific to territory type and current population
- **Chain Events**: Some events can trigger follow-up events
- **Seasonal Events**: Time-based events that occur periodically
- **Milestone Events**: Population threshold events that unlock content

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize event calculation loops
- Use efficient population counting
- Implement proper widget rebuilding for population updates
- Consider event history cleanup for memory management
- Add settings for event frequency

When writing code, focus on event-driven population mechanics, territory expansion, and creating meaningful immigration narratives through the event system.
