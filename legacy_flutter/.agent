# Agent Instructions

## Linting & Code Quality
- **Always Analyze**: Before finishing any task, run `flutter analyze`.
- **Test Before Push**: Run `dev.bat test` (or `flutter test`) to ensure all tests pass.
- **Fix All Issues**: Ensure no new linting errors or warnings are introduced. If you touch a file with existing issues, fix them if relevant.
- **Formatting**: Run `dart format .` to maintain code style.

## Repository Syncing
- **Pull Before Work**: Always run `git pull` before starting a new session to stay in sync.
- **Standard Sync Workflow**:
  1. `flutter analyze`
  2. `dev.bat test`
  3. `git add .`
  4. `git commit -m "brief description of changes"`
  5. `git push`
- **Verify Before Push**: Never push code that breaks tests or has linting errors.
