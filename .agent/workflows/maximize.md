---

1. Read `.agent/INSTRUCTIONS.md` to refresh on the project's quality bar.
2. Analyze the current file or specific components for:
   - Cinematic UI/UX (Motion, Glassmorphism, HUD feel)
   - Architecture (Clean state, Domain services, Typing)
   - Performance (Memoization, Asset loading)
   - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1, keyboard shortcuts)
3. Propose and implement specific improvements that bridge the gap from "MVP" to "Maximum Potential".
4. Verify changes using Playwright tests.
