description: Review and improve the current file/project based on cinematic and technical standards
---

1. Read `.agent/INSTRUCTIONS.md` to refresh on the project's quality bar.
2. Analyze the current file or specific components for:
   - Cinematic UI/UX (Glass HUD, Motion Orchestration, Scanner Effect, Odometer Digits)
   - Architecture (Domain services, Modifier Engine, Web Workers, Server Actions)
   - Performance (Memoization, Web Vitals, Asset Pipelining, Virtualization)
   - Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA, Keyboard Mastery, High-Contrast Dark Mode)
   - Gameplay Systems (Policy Cards, Resource Interdependency, Visual Evolution)
3. Propose and implement specific improvements that bridge the gap from "MVP" to "Maximum Potential".
4. Verify changes using Vitest unit tests (`npm test`) and Playwright e2e tests (`npm run test:e2e`).
